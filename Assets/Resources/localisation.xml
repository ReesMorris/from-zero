    	<string name="fuel_station_88">ABBY: But I'm still me, I would never do that! Ever!</string>
    	<string name="fuel_station_89">FRANK: The guy who attacked him was my taxi driver.</string>
    	<string name="fuel_station_90">He was bitten too, but he seemed normal at first.</string>
    	<string name="fuel_station_91">Then, just suddenly, he collapsed at the wheel. We crashed. Hit a tree.</string>
